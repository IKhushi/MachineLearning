### My Notes on Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence.  

#### 3 Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning - learns using labeled training data.  Training data has input and output.  
2. Unsupervised learning - learns using unlabled training data.  Training data is input but has no output.  Algorithm finds structure. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning. Examples: social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.  
3. Reinforcement learning - learns to take action by maximizing a cumulative reward. [deep mind learns breakout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk)  

#### 2 Types of machine learning problems
1. regression - predicting a continuous value attribute (Example: house prices)
2. classification - predicting a discrete value. (Example: pass or fail, hot dog/not hot dog)

#### Types of classification  
Binary classification - classifying elements into one of two groups. Examples: benign/malignant tumor, fraudulent or legitimate financial transaction, spam or non-spam email.  

[Multiclass classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification)/multinomial classification - classify instances into more than 2 classes. Example: MNIST evaluates handwritten single numeric characters and classifies into 10 binary classes 0 - 9.
