### My Notes on Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that uses data to generate predictive models.  

#### 3 Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning - learns using labeled training data.  Training data has input and output.  
2. Unsupervised learning - learns using unlabled training data.  Training data is input but has no output.  Algorithm finds structure. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning. Examples: social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.  
3. Reinforcement learning - learns to take action by maximizing a cumulative reward. [deep mind learns breakout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk)  

#### 2 Types of machine learning problems
1. regression - predicting a continuous value attribute (Example: house prices)
2. classification - predicting a discrete value. (Example: pass or fail, hot dog/not hot dog)
