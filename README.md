### My Notes on Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that uses data to generate predictive models.  

#### 3 Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning - learns using labeled training data.  Training data has input and output.  
2. Unsupervised learning - learns using unlabled training data.  Training data is input but has no output.  Algorithm finds structure. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning. Examples: social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.  
3. Reinforcement learning - an agent interacts with an environment and learns to take action by maximizing a cumulative reward.  

#### 2 Types of machine learning problems
1. regression - predicting a continuous value attribute (Example: house prices)
2. classification - predicting a discrete value. (Example: pass or fail, hot dog/not hot dog)

### Machine learning models and applications

[Neural Nets](https://github.com/andrewt3000/MachineLearning/blob/master/neuralNets.md) - A primer on neural networks.  NNs are a suitable model for fixed input features and output labels.    

[Recurrent Neural Nets](https://github.com/andrewt3000/MachineLearning/blob/master/rnn.md) - A primer on recurrent neural networks. RNNs are a suitable model for sequences of information.   

[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/andrewt3000/MachineLearning/blob/master/cnn4Images.md) A primer for CNNs. CNNS are suitable models for 2d grids of information such as an image.   

[Deep Learning for NLP](https://github.com/andrewt3000/DL4NLP/blob/master/README.md) State of the art deep learning models and nlp applications such as sentiment analysis, translation and dialog generation.
